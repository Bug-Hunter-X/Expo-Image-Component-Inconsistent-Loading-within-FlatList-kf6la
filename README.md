# Expo Image Loading Issue in FlatList

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered with Expo's `Image` component when used inside a `FlatList`. Images load inconsistently, sometimes appearing and sometimes not, without any clear errors in the console. This issue is particularly frustrating as it results in unpredictable UI behavior.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.js` presents a solution to address the inconsistent image loading.  The solution involves using a combination of techniques to ensure reliable image display.
